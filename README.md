# ✋ MULTI GESTURE DETECTOR 🤖

This project is a real-time hand gesture recognition system using **MediaPipe**, **OpenCV**, and a **TensorFlow/Keras deep learning model**. It allows users to perform various hand gestures that are detected live via webcam.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam
- 🧠 Custom-trained model using TensorFlow/Keras
- 📷 MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark tracking
- 🎯 Confidence threshold and cooldown logic for stable predictions
- 🔁 Support for multiple gestures including:
  - Hello 👋
  - Fist ✊
  - Thumbs Up 👍
  - Thumbs Down 👎
  - Peace ✌️
  - Stop ✋
  - Okay 👌
  - Rock 🤘
  - Call Me 🤙

## 🧠 Model Training

To train your own model:

1. Record data using `collect_data.py`
2. Train the model using `train_model.py`
3. Ensure the model is saved as `model.keras`

## 🤩 Future Enhancements

- 🔥 Two-hand gesture detection
- 🌐 Web-based UI with Flask
- 💾 Save gesture history/log
- 🧠 Integrate voice feedback or system control
